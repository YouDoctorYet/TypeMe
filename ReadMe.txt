This is a typing game, titled: The Typing Game

The main file is titled "TP 2.py".

To properly run the game all modules as noted on top of the file must be installed. This includes PIL and random_word modules. 

From the splash screen, there are 3 options. 

Single player mode trains your typing skills by tracking which finger you missed the most and target that finger through words that require that finger. Player is not required to do anything other than typing. 

Multiplayer mode inherited the same features; but it requires collaboration between two players, ideally, one to control and dodge enemy attacks using left/right arrow keys while the other types the words.

In both modes, on the top right corner of the screen will display area of improvement (aka weakest finger) as well as current score and current word that is being typed on. 

Help mode as the name applies simply describes what the player is supposed to do. 

Press Tab to instantly end game (in order to test leaderboard and endgame mode).

Press Esc to pause. 

If an error message about results not found pops up, it has to do with the random_word module which apparently bugs out like that from time to time. Refreshing the program multiple times should help. 

Enjoy!
